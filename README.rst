Python Bindings for xxHash
==========================

Package Description
-------------------
This package provides a Python interface to the xxHash fast non-cryptographic
hash algorithm. Inspired by `existing Python wrappers for xxHash
<https://github.com/ewencp/pyhashxx/>`_, this package exposes both the 32 and
64-bit versions of the algorithm and leverages `Cython <https://cython.org>`_ to
provide better support for incremental updating of a hash using data
encapsulated in a range of Python container classes. The package is compatible
with Python 2.7 and later.
